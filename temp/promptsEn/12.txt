Now, you need to check if each output conforms to the rules, especially the correspondence of numbers and the absence of omissions. For example, input 4 might require a more specific context, but if none is provided, the input could be used as the output. However, according to rule 14, you can diverge, such as "on the brink of death" or "near death." Similarly, input 8 might require more specific elements, but "memory" might not be visually evocative enough; it may need adjustment.
