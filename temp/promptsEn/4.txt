"Never thought I could穿越回来." The action here is "to go back through time and return," but the verb needs to have strong visual imagery. Possible outputs could be "穿越" or "返回," but according to the rules, if the verb lacks strong visual imagery, no output is given. However, "穿越" itself has strong visual imagery, so the output is "穿越."
