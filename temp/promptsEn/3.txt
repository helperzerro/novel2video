Output 1: "I found myself in the esoteric realm a millennium after my death." The main element here is "esoteric realm", which might require more specific visual details. However, following the rule, if more specificity cannot be extracted, it might be necessary to expand. Given the abstract nature of "esoteric realm", it might be useful to find a more concrete term, such as "esoteric world" or "transcendental setting". However, based on the user's example, it might be appropriate to directly use the original term. Therefore, the output is "esoteric realm".
